# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Lab Documentation

## Overview
This lab involved performing Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) at Low, Medium, and High security levels. The objective was to identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities to understand web application security weaknesses. The lab was conducted using the Kali Linux VM customized for the Cisco Ethical Hacker course, with DVWA accessed at `http://10.6.6.13`. Below is a detailed account of the steps I took and my findings.
